Title: Wellness App Project

I’ve just started the very beginnings of a new coding project. As I’ve been studying Miguel Grinberg’s Flask book, I wanted to take a stab at my own project to implement some of the features I am learning about in a more creative environment. I find that this helps my ability to grasp new concepts much more thoroughly than just reading along and typing in the code provided. 

My project idea is to create an app that will track and display various elements of my wellness practices and biometrics in one spot. For instance, I am using the Oura API to extract my nightly sleep metrics and plan to use WTForms to implement radio selectors for how I am feeling, as well as a text form to describe how I am feeling overall. I plan to use a calendar layout to be able to access individual days over time (likely using fullcalendar). I will also have a page for trends/insights.

I’m also toying with the idea of incorporating a workout tracker within the app, so that I can track how sleep is impacting my workouts and consolidate some of the different apps and items I use each day into a one-stop shop.
