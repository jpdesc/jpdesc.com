Title: Deploying my Wellness App

I’ve recently been working a lot with Ansible, a configuration management platform, which allows users to automate the setup of their infrastructure. My biggest project to date has been completely automating the deployment of my wellness app with an Ansible playbook. Although it took a lot of toggling--particularly with regards to getting my database set up properly, the effort was well worth the satisfaction and comfort of knowing I can easily deploy to any virtual private server.

Through the process, I learned quite a bit about networking, virtual servers and how to use several different types of config files. Through the sheer amount of time debugging and shuffling through my Ubuntu private server (from DigitalOcean) making adjustments and checking the results of my Ansible playbooks, I've gained a lot of skills in the Unix command line, which has had lots of carry-over into just about everything coding related I am working on.
