Title: More Algo Practice

Recently, I’ve taken a bit of a break from developing my app and have been putting the bulk of my focus into practicing algorithms. I’ve been tackling the [Blind 75 Leetcode Problems](https://www.teamblind.com/post/New-Year-Gift---Curated-List-of-Top-75-LeetCode-Questions-to-Save-Your-Time-OaM1orEU) , a curated list of leetcode problems grouped into type of problem/data structure with increasing difficulty.

My strategy for making the most of my learning so far has been to practice 2-3 problems each day, while taking detailed notes on each problem in an excel sheet. More specifically, I’ve been logging how difficult each problem is on the first pass, the type of problem and a written explanation of the solution. I found a helpful YouTube channel called [Neetcode](https://www.youtube.com/c/neetcode) that has straightforward explanations of each problem’s solution(s) with discussion of time complexity and cleanest approaches.

The repetition of practicing each day has started to catch on, as I am feeling decent on most Leetcode medium problems, whereas a few months ago, I was unable to crack any of the easy problems. I’m looking forward to seeing how this might impact the speed at which I am able to code in real-world problems, as it seems to have improved my problem-solving abilities greatly.
