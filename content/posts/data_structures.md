Title: Data Structures and Algorithms

In addition to my wellness app, I’ve also been focusing on improving my practical knowledge of data structures and algorithms. I am using AlgoExpert, a service which combines instructional videos on the different types of data structures with 160 practice problems. What I like about it so far is that the problems are categorized by data structure type, such that I can easily practice several problems that pertain to the same data structure. This allows me to develop more consistent approaches to problem solving for each data structure type. To supplement, I’ve started reading The Algorithm Design Manual by Steven Skiena. 

I am looking forward to improving my ability to find increasingly more time and space efficient approaches to my code. I’ve already noticed an awareness that previously wasn’t there with regards to certain structures like nested loops that are particularly expensive with regards to time. Where possible, I am making improvements, or at least starting to recognize the demands and constraints of certain types of algorithms within my code.
